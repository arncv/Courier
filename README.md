## Inspiration
The inspiration for PowerNap comes from the need to improve productivity while working. Often, we feel tired and sluggish in the middle of the day and don't know how to recharge our energy. PowerNap aims to solve this problem by providing a quick nap timer that helps you take power naps to enhance productivity.
What it does

## What it does
PowerNap is a quick nap timer that allows users to set a timer for a short nap and receive notifications via SMS & email as an alarm when the timer ends. The app also includes a feature for tracking productivity with an inbuilt pomodoro timer as well as has sleep sounds while taking a power nap
 
## How we built it
We built PowerNap using JavaScript and HTML/CSS for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. We also used a web framework called Express.js to handle routing and implemented a notification system using the Courier API.

## Challenges we ran into
Worked solo on this project and had to figure out all the technical aspects on our own. Also, balancing the time for coding and researching new technologies was a challenge. Additionally, finding the right tools and technologies that fit the project requirements was difficult at times.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of successfully creating a timer app that specifically focuses on quick naps and their benefits for productivity. We are also proud of being able to implement a notification system that sends notifications at the correct time and displays them correctly.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about building web applications using JavaScript, and about the importance of user research and testing in the development process.

## What's next for PowerNap
We also plan to make the app available on mobile devices and integrate it with other productivity apps.
